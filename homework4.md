# Uncertainty Analysis of the Ten-Bar Truss

## Please obtain the final distribution of the stress at bar No.5 and No.6

Ran with $10^6$ times.

Where red and green data is bar No.5 and No.6 respectively.

## What is the probability of Bar 1 failing using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) with 1 million samples

There is no failed in Monte Carlo Simulation.

Where yellow and blue data is bar No.1 and $Y$ respectively.
The plot represents there is no intersection between the stress of No.1 and the limitation.
