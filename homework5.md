# Design under Uncertainty

## Please use Monte Carlo simulation with 100 samples to solve the problem. Rerun twice, are the results different? Did you face convergence difficulties? Why?

## Please use Monte Carlo simulation with 1 million samples to solve the problem. Rerun twice, are the results different? Did you face convergence difficulties? Why?

## Please use FOSM to solve the problem. Use Monte Carlo to verify the failure probability at the optimal. Did you get 99% results? Why not?
